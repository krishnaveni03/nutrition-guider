# Indian Food Classification

## Introduction

The **Indian Food Classification** project is an exciting machine learning endeavor that seeks to classify a diverse array of traditional Indian dishes based on their nutritional attributes, particularly focusing on the fat content of these delectable foods.

## Project Goals

### Promoting Awareness

One of the primary goals of this project is to promote awareness about the nutritional aspects of Indian cuisine. Indian food is renowned for its rich flavors and regional diversity. However, understanding the nutritional content of these dishes is crucial for making informed dietary choices.

### Classification and Prediction

The heart of the project lies in the development of a robust machine learning model that can classify various Indian dishes based on their ingredients and, most importantly, predict their fat content. By doing so, we aim to empower individuals to make healthier food choices while savoring the flavors of India.
